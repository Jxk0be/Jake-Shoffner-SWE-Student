# Jake Shoffner SWE Student Website

The purpose of this project is to rebuild my old website that was created during my time learning ReactJS for the first time.

## Description

This project took a lot of inspiration from the first iteration of my website. Some of the main differences include: using React Router instead of a SPA, data management through JSON instead of hard-coded data, and a major style overhaul with some small CSS animations.
